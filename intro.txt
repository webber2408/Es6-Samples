What's up guys? This is Rahul here, and I am highly pumped to go ahead and take up
this JS Master Course guys in which we gonna be diving deep into the world of JavaScript, 
How it works, both on screen & behind the screen (i.e. basically how it executes). Along with those we 
are going to cover a lot more interesting concepts like Scopes, Functions, Closures, Promises, Generators
and what not guys!

So let's just begin!

In this particular video, we are going to learn What is JavaScript? And Why the heck we need it?
Other than that we gonna be covering two more topics that are variables and value types!
